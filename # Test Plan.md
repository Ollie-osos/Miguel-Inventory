# Test Plan  

## intro

This test plan is to check the inventory site works as prescribed from the system requirements. 

To test the site I will use a browser to click through and check each of the requirements works. at minimum I expect all core functionality to work on desktop google chrome and safari. 

I will not be testing the application on mobile and tablet devices, or testing site speed and performance as these were not specified as integral parts of the build.
